      <h3>The Story</h3>
      <p>I applied to do a BSc Masters Degree at UCT in April 2020.</p>
      <p>
        UCT was supposed to let me know if I was accepted by September 2020.
      </p>
      <p>I was only notified in November 2020.</p>
      <p>Funding applications closed in October 2020.</p>
      <p>This left me <strong>F*CKED!</strong></p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>The Situation</h3>
      <p>Fees for the year are R61 000.</p>
      <p>I've managed to cover R29 125 of it through my 13th cheque.</p>
      <p>This leaves a shortfall of R30 885 to be paid by 30th June 2021.</p>
      <p>Here's where you come in.</p>
    </article>

      <h3>The Sell</h3>
      <p>
        Please help me become a Master of Science by crowdfunding the R30 885
        still outstanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you chose to donate there obviously needs to be something in it for
        you too :D!
      </p>
      <p>All funders get to be on the Wall of Gratitude with a caption!</p>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <div class="faq-card">
        <p class="question">Why can't I self fund the rest?</p>
        <p class="answer">
          I'm currently over R100 000 in student debt which I am still paying
          off monthly
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-card">
        <p class="question">
          How do I send details to get on the Wall of Gratitude?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          Message me on
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dgb/">LinkedIn</a> and I will
          reply with email address where you can send the picture and caption
          you want loaded.
        </p>

      <div class="faq-card">
        <p class="question">Do I need to be put on the Wall of Gratitude?</p>
        <p class="answer">
          If you'd prefer to donate in the shadows that is 100% fine, the Wall
          of Gratitude is simply there to give a shoutout to those who'd like
          one.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-card">
        <p class="question">How can I trust you?</p>
        <p class="answer">
          Most likely you will only see this website if you know who I am and
          then I hope my reputation speaks for itself. If however this is not
          the case then the only thing I can give you is my word which is my
          bond.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-card">
        <p class="question">What happens if the target is reached?</p>
        <p class="answer">
          I will add Proof of Payment to the site and update it accordingly. The
          Wall of Gratitude will remain for the rest of the year before the
          domain name expires.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-card">
        <p class="question">
          What happens if the amount isn't reached by 30 June 2021?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">
          The total amount that has been donated will be transferred into UCT's
          account.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interest will be added to the outstanding amount and I will need to
          wait until my next 13th cheque at the end of this year to cover the
          rest (or more money will trickle in from funders which will be used to
          pay the rest before then).
