      <h3>The Story</h3>
      <p>I applied to do a BSc Masters Degree at UCT in April 2020.</p>
      <p>
        UCT was supposed to let me know if I was accepted by September 2020.
      </p>
      <p>I was only notified in November 2020.</p>
      <p>Funding applications closed in October 2020.</p>
      <p>Leaving me <strong>F*CKED!</strong></p>

      <h3>The Situation</h3>
      <p>Fees for the year are R61 000.</p>
      <p>I've managed to cover R29 125 of it through my 13th cheque.</p>
      <p>This leaves a shortfall of R30 885.</p>
      <p>Here's where you come in.</p>

        you too :D!
